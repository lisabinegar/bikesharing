## Statistical Analysis Overview

The goal of this statistical analysis was to determine if a bike sharing program, similar to the Citi Bike program in New York City, would be viable in a metropolitan area in the Midwest. We wanted to be able to show potential investors weighing the long term viability of a bike sharing program to be launched in Des Moines, IA, and created several visualizations in Tableau to show investors a what the demographics are of the customer base of Citi Bike in NYC. Visualizations were created to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and to show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### Is there supportive data underlying the bike sharing program proposal for Des Moines, IA? 

## Results

There are supportive data to support the bike sharing program being proposed for Des Moines, IA. I will review each visualization below and how it provides support to our underlying proposal. 

### Checkout Time for Users 
- We graphed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. We learned that the vast majority of riders checkout bikes for less than an hour, with a peak of around 10-20 minutes at a time. 

### Checkout Times by Gender
- We graphed the length of checkout time for bikes based on the rider's gender, and found that males overwhelmingly utilize the bike sharing program over females. Over 100,000 bikes were rented by males, and around 30,000 bikes were checked out by females. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
- We created a heatmap to show the most popular times of the day that bikes are rented through Citi Bike. There was a clear uptick in usage for both morning and evening commutes on the weekdays. Weekends also showed some utilization of Citi Bikes, but more spread out throughout the day with a gradual increase starting midmorning through late afternoon, presumably as people rent bikes for leisure activities. 

### Trips by Gender
- This visualization combines the trips by weekday per hour with checkout times by gender. We are able to see again the clear increase of usage in male customers over females, as well as when males and females are checking out bikes. Across both genders, there is an increase in bike usage during morning and evening commute time periods. 

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
- We created a more succinct summary of the user trips by gender during the weekdays, as well as looked at the two types of users: "Customer" and "Subscriber." There is a clear preference for the Subscriber model, for both males and females, over the Customer model. This may be due to generous rates for Subscribers over one-time customers. 

### Bike Repair 
- This is a visualization created for the initial leg of data analysis (from the module). Bicycle repair and replacement will be an ongoing expense after initial costs and investments of startup, and we were interested to learn some bikes get much higher usage than others, likely based on where they are located in NYC. The ability to record and track the hours a bike is used will serve in proper care and maintenance of the bicycle fleet. 

### Bike Utilization
- This visualization further demonstrates individual bicycle usage, and will determine when bikes may be due for repair and maintenance. It is evident from this visualization and Bike Repair that some bikes are infrequently utilized, and that others are heavily used. 

## Summary

This data analysis helps create a foundation for understanding the popularity and expenses of a bike sharing program. While New York City is not Des Moines, there are some basic principles that we would expect to carry forward in any bike sharing program, as evidence in the Tableau Story. Bikes are generally rented for short periods of time, and as the Des Moines metro area has a smaller foot print than Manhattan, limited rental periods may also be the case. Male users more commonly utilize Citi Bikes, particularly for weekday commutes, and this could also be duplicated in Des Moines. A Subscriber model is more popular than a Customer model, and this would not only provide ongoing revenue, but could be grown through marketin gand word of mouth campaigns. Bike wear and tear will certainly be an ongoing expense, though this can potentially be decreased by a systematic rotation of heavily used bicycles with rarely used bicycles in order to better spread out bike depreciation. 

There are at last two additional visualizations that would be useful to consider as we move forward with this project. One might be what the career or vocation is of riders, and if those industries are similar to the major industries present in downtown Des Moines. What are the numbers of workers who commute in and out of the downtown area, and how far are their commutes? Are they comparable to riders in Manhattan who may work in that borough and live in a neighboring borough? Secondly, are the roads and city streets in Des Moines painted and built to accommodate an increase in bike riders, as NYC is structured? Or are there structural differences between the two cities that would make an influx of bike riders impractical or even dangerous? The local infrastructure between the two cities must also be compared.
